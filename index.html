      <p>
        It’s the beginning of the year, an ideal time to make
some plans and hope they are magically fulfilled.

But maybe I can do better than that. Firstly, instead of planning books to read for the whole of 2023,
I would like to list 10 books that I will read by the first half of the year. This way, if I’m behind schedule, 
I still have half a year t... <a href="/2023/01/03/10-books-to-learn-2023.html"><i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i></a>

        This article was inspired by a technical interview I’ve had recently
to verify my skills as a test automation engineer. My answer was
somewhat vague, but passable. If you’re applying for any position 
where you’re going to use JavaScript on a daily basis, there’s a
decent probability you’ll get asked this one. So let’s explore the

        I was running yesterdy in the forest. I had my new Brooks running shoes which felt so amazing on the feet. And I was doing pretty much everything except being focused on the running.

        Bash aliases?

Bash aliases allow you to run complex instructions to your terminal with a just a few keystrokes. For example, you can have 
an alias for some routine task which takes time to type and is tedious.

        Some time ago I was writing a Cypress test and opening a lot of tabs with Cypress documentation. At some point I became haunted by the idea that opening these doc pages over and over multiple times is a waste of energy and may have some impact on climate change.

Hours later I was becoming acquainted with the reports about the impact of ICT (Inf... <a href="/2022/07/03/offline-docs.html"><i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i></a>
