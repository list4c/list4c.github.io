  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I was running yesterdy in the forest. I had my new Brooks running shoes which felt so amazing on the feet. And I was doing pretty much everything except being focused on the running. Listening to music. Making plans in my head. Trying to make the Google Voice Assistant do what I expected from it, by saying “Decrease the volume”, getting interpreted as “Increase the volume” (haha). In short, I was not paying much attention to the surroundings.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain in my foot and had to stop. A wooden branch was lying on the ground, and it felt like something pierced the shoe.</p>

<p>I ran a little more and decided to examine my foot. Sure enough, the shoe was pierced by some spiky part of the branch. I took the shoe off and took out a small piece of wooden splinter from the shoe. The pain was moderate, but the surprise was much greater. My shoe was had been pierced by a piece of wood… I still find it hard to believe.</p>

<p>More than 24 hours later, it still hurts, though it’s healing pretty well. But this incident somehow stuck in my head. I really wish that other runners avoid my fate. So…</p>

<h2 id="three-lessons">Three Lessons</h2>

<p>The lessons I draw from this incident?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nature is powerful!</li>
  <li>Running requires full focus. You can’t just rely on the autopilot, or you might crash</li>
  <li>The best equipment will not protect you if you are not careful enough</li>
</ul>
